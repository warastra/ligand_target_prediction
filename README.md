# BindingDB ligand target

the model esm2_viral_protein.pt is fine-tuned from facebook's ESM-2 to predict whether a protein comes from virus or not from their amino acid sequence. the model is trained on proteins found in <a href='https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb6496315b'>BindingDB ligand target dataset</a>
