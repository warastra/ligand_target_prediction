# BindingDB ligand target

## Viral Protein Classification
The model `esm2_viral_protein.pt` is fine-tuned from facebook's ESM-2 to predict whether a protein comes from virus or not from their amino acid sequence. the model is trained on proteins found in <a href='https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb6496315b'>BindingDB ligand target dataset</a>

## Ligand-Target Binding Affinity Prediction
The `esm2_viral_protein_ligand_IC50_100nM_classifier_v3_final.pt` is a classification model predicting if the IC50 value of a small molecule ligand and protein pair is below certain threshold (10 nM). Trained on BindingDB dataset.
